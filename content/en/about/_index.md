Hi, I'm aren227 who dream of making a awesome video game someday. Doing game-related programming mostly.

As you may have noticed, I'm not a native English speaker. Still trying to get used to it. Please understand that my writings can feel awkward.

I'm living in South Korea, undergraduate in computer science. I'm planning to write a post in Korean occasionally.
